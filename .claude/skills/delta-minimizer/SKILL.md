# Δ-Minimizer

We copy-trade a target wallet (e.g. `swisstony`) on Polymarket. Our positions should match theirs. Every divergence is a bug. The algorithm has known fundamental issues — your job is to find ONE, prove it, file it, move on.

## Required reading BEFORE you query anything

You are expected to already understand the system. If you don't, read these — they are short and load-bearing:

- `docs/spec/poly-copy-trade-execution.md` — mirror-side rules, decision-ledger contract, `MirrorPositionView` (per-condition cache; `our_token_id` = OUR dominant side), error codes, lifecycle, sizing surfaces. **Branch decision (post-bug.5048) is target-dominance-driven** — see the "Branch decision" table + skip-precedence + `TARGET_DOMINANCE_DRIVES_BRANCH` / `NEVER_PAY_ABOVE_TARGET_VWAP` / `NO_SELL_IN_MIRROR` / `OPTION_C_TOLERATES_MULTI_TARGET` invariants. When investigating wrong-side / wrong-size Δ, always check `state.target_position` side fractions, not just our position. The dashboard reads `current-position-read-model.ts` (chain-classified by `poly_market_outcomes`), NOT `MirrorPositionView` — never claim UI behavior without verifying the actual read model.
- `docs/spec/poly-tenant-and-collateral.md` — per-tenant wallets, USDC.e (deposit) vs pUSD (the ONLY currency the CLOB spends), `authorizeIntent` pre-place gate (grants/caps, NOT balance), v0 default caps. `errorCode=insufficient_balance` ≠ "we ran out of money"; it specifically means the wallet has USDC.e but not pUSD (TEN:712).
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/plan-mirror.ts` + `types.ts` — the `MirrorReason` enum (`below_target_percentile`, `followup_position_too_small`, `position_cap_reached`, `already_resting`, `layer_scale_in`, `target_dominant_other_side`, `vwap_floor_breach`, etc.) is in code, not the spec. `decideMirrorBranch` + `analyzeTargetDominance` + `targetVwapForToken` are the load-bearing helpers.

Canonical CLOB `errorCode` enum (EXEC:693): `insufficient_balance | insufficient_allowance | stale_api_key | invalid_signature | invalid_price_or_tick | below_min_order_size | empty_response | http_error | unknown`.

## Discipline (read this twice)

1. **One discrepancy per pass.** Not three. Not a top-K list. The user names ONE market, ONE token, ONE side — you investigate that. If they hand you several, ask which one first.
2. **Every claim must be backed by a specific DB row or a specific Loki log line, pasted in your response.** No "likely cause." No "probably." No agent-summarized narrative — those hallucinate conditionIds and event titles. If you can't paste the evidence, you don't make the claim.
3. **Verify the basics before theorizing.** Confirm the conditionId. Confirm the tokenId. Confirm whose wallet. Confirm timestamps.
4. **Drive through to logs in the same pass — never stop on a Postgres-only read.** Decision rows with `outcome='error', receipt=null` tell you NOTHING about why. The actual `errorCode` lives on the pino log line, not the DB row. A pass is not complete until you have both: the decisions/fills row AND the matching Loki line(s) for any non-`placed` outcome. If Loki retention has aged out (>7d), say so explicitly — don't infer.
5. **One verifiable finding per pass.** End the pass with: (a) the question, (b) the evidence rows/lines, (c) the conclusion, (d) the next narrower question. ONE finding does not mean ONE query — it means you keep digging until the finding is provable, then stop.
6. **Never theorize about UI behavior.** If the answer depends on what the dashboard shows or hides, read `nodes/poly/app/src/.../current-position-read-model.ts` (and the API route serving the panel) and paste the relevant code. Don't speculate that the UI "collapses" or "hides" anything.

## Evidence sources — these are the ONLY ones allowed

### Postgres (via Grafana proxy)

Datasource UID for prod: `cogni-production-poly-postgres`. Helper: `scripts/grafana-postgres-query.sh '<SQL>' --env production --node poly`. Read-only (SELECT/WITH/SHOW/EXPLAIN).

**Schema gotchas to know up front:**

- `poly_copy_trade_decisions.decided_at` (NOT `created_at`) is the timestamp column, **`timestamp with time zone`** — compare with `to_timestamp(<seconds>)`, not bare epoch ints.
- `poly_copy_trade_decisions.target_id` is a deterministic UUIDv5 derived from the **lowercased target wallet alone** (helper: `targetIdFromWallet(wallet)` in `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/target-id.ts`), while `poly_copy_trade_targets.id` is a random UUIDv4. They do NOT join — the v5 is shared across all tenants tracking that wallet, the v4 is per-tenant. Joining the two tables on `target_id = id` returns zero rows. To find decisions for swisstony, filter by `intent->>'target_wallet'` or grab the v5 id from a sample row first. Full canonical note: [`docs/spec/poly-copy-trade-execution.md` § "Target identity in the decision/fill ledger"](../../../docs/spec/poly-copy-trade-execution.md#target-identity-in-the-decisionfill-ledger).
- `intent->>'market_id'` has the form `prediction-market:polymarket:0xCONDITION_ID`, not the bare condition_id. `intent->>'position_token_id'` is often null on `new_entry` decisions; the actual token_id is in the `fill_id` string after the second `:`.
- `poly_trader_wallets.kind`: `copy_target` for the wallets we mirror, `cogni_wallet` for our own.

Most relevant tables (schemas in `nodes/poly/packages/db-schema/src/`):

### Loki (literal history tracing)

Helper: `scripts/loki-query.sh '<logql>' [minutes_back=30] [limit=200]`. Standard selector for prod poly node: `{env="production",service="app",pod=~"poly-node-app-.*"}`. **Retention is ~7 days** — if your incident is older, say so and don't fabricate.

`component` labels (pino) you'll actually use:

- `component="mirror-pipeline"` — the decision engine. Every non-`placed` decision row has a matching `level=50` log here carrying the real `errorCode` (which is NEVER in `decisions.receipt`).
- `component="copy-trade-executor"` — the CLOB place call. Look here for raw CLOB rejection bodies.
- `component="polymarket-ws-source"` — wallet-watch ingestion (target's fills entering our system).
- `component="order-reconciler"` — order-status sync back to DB.
- `component="mirror-job"` — outer scheduler.

Queries that actually return something:

```bash
# What did mirror-pipeline say for a given fill_id? (substring match on the fill_id)
scripts/loki-query.sh '{env="production",service="app"} | json | component="mirror-pipeline" |~ "FILL_HEX_PREFIX"' 1440 200

# Every place attempt on a tokenId in the last day
scripts/loki-query.sh '{env="production",service="app"} | json | component="copy-trade-executor" |~ "TOKEN_ID_HERE"' 1440 200

# Recent placement errors with their errorCode (most useful)
scripts/loki-query.sh '{env="production",service="app"} |~ "placement_failed"' 1440 50
```

## Example walkthrough — one pass

**User**: "Our wallet shows UNDER 41 sh on Chelsea v Nott Forest O/U 3.5 while swisstony shows OVER 31k sh. Why are we on the wrong side?"

**Step 1 — verify the basics.** Look up wallets in `poly_trader_wallets` (label = swisstony / our cogni_wallet). Find our 41.28-sh position via `poly_trader_fills` aggregation (group by `condition_id, token_id`, filter on share count + vwap). Pull the exact `condition_id` and `token_id`. Cross-check: did the target trade BOTH outcomes on this condition? `select … where condition_id=? group by token_id` — many "wrong-side" appearances are the target having scalped both sides; the apparent inversion is then a sizing/execution issue, not a side-flip.

**Step 2 — pull every decision the mirror made for that target on that condition.** Use query template #2. Read them in time order. Categorize each by `outcome` + `reason`. If all `placed` decisions are on token X and the target's actual fills are on token X, the mirror's side-selection is fine. If you see a meaningful number of `outcome='error'` rows, **that is the central failure**, not whichever side won.

**Step 3 — drive through to Loki in the SAME pass.** `decisions.receipt` is `null` on errors; the `errorCode` only lives on the Pino line. Paste the JSON line and read the `errorCode`. Cross-reference against the CLOB enum and the collateral spec. Only then write up.

**Step 4 — write up.** Question, 3–5 rows/lines of raw evidence, conclusion grounded in those rows, next narrower question. Do not theorize about UI behavior — if the UI is in play, read the read-model code.

## What this skill does NOT do

- No aggregate scorecards, no |Δ| histograms, no failure-mode taxonomies until a single case is fully proven.
- No auto-filing of work items. After a proven finding, the user (or you on explicit ask) files a concrete bug with evidence pasted inline.
- No reading from `/api/v1/poly/wallet/execution` — it aggregates server-side and obscures the underlying rows.
- No subagent reports as primary evidence. Subagents can fetch raw rows/lines; you read them yourself.
- **No claims about what the dashboard "shows" or "hides" without reading the read-model file.** `MirrorPositionView` has a dominant-side selection; the dashboard read model may or may not — find out by reading code, not by guessing.
- **No ending a pass with "Postgres said X, want me to check Loki?"** If Loki is the next step, just run it. Pareto baby step = one finding, not one query.
